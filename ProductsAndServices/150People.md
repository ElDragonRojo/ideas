A very small social network for your 150 closest friends.

## Opportunity 

One complaint with traditional social networks is that you have so many "friends" that you don't have any actual friends. Thre's no way you can know all the people you are following, and certainly no way you can keep up with their lives with any degree of real empathy.

Twitter used to be something that was limited, so it was a useful way to communicate with your friends, unlike the noisy, data-heavy Facebook, which was more like a scrapbook you shared with your parents, and former and current classmates and coworkers.

The genius of Twitter was limiting what you could say in a message to 140 characters. As @ev said:

> You can change the world with 140 characters.

One of the places Twitter fails is in not limiting the number of people you can follow.


## Theory

A social network limited to 150 people would force you to pick the people you really care about. Anybody else would have to be a moved into a larger list of acquaintances that is more of a cloud for trends.

## Social

What makes this social network interesting is the inevitable scandal that results from having you real friends known. 150 people is a large enough list that it won't mess with your core group, but when it comes to Internet friends, there is a lot of potential for drama.

Leverage this by having each profile contain a detailed description of who this person is, and how you know them. These intimate profiles are only possible because this will become an intensely curated list.

## Implementation

I would personally build this as an app on top of ADN then make versions for other existing social networks. 

You can trivially prototype this anywhere you can make a list of people, such as:

* A list on Twitter
* A group in Address Book
* The spreadsheet of your choice
* Names on a piece of paper

## Monetization

What's nice about this idea as a business is you can use monetization to enhance the other important aspect of any great social network, which is as a _social experiment_.

The basic idea is that if you share everything openly, everything is free, but if the politics of your personal relationships are such that you want or need to keep secrets, _you'll have to pay_.

You can make as many lists as you want for free, but if you want them to be secret, or if you want to replace the politically meaningful numbers with more neutral bullet points, you'll have to pay.

As with GitHub, you can sign up for an account and have up to 150 friends with profiles for free, as well as unlimited acquaintences without profiles for free.

Like the GitHub model, you can purchase private profiles, as well as features like adding notes to acquaintencesâ€”but not full profiles, and **never more than 150 friends!**

You can also charge for the priviledge of sharing links, pictures, audio, movies, and other media. You do not have to pay for viewing these things: only for posting them.

Having to pay for these things pays for the bandwidth for hosting them, and it makes it much less likely that people will post crap, so the people consuming the media for free will enjoy it more.

## Other ideas

If you really want to spice things up, require that the lists be ordered, so you have to actually rank people. If you want to make the list unordered, to spare yourself the headache, you have to pay. If you want to try this without ruining thing, you can make it a feature: ordered lists, as a sharable asset, starting with the five favorite people list.

It's not necessarily a bad idea to let people know who the most important people are in your life. If something where to happen to you, it would be very important to have an easily accessible list of your most important people to notify. You can have some circles and sublists, such as:

* People to contact in case of emergency
* People to contact in case I am hopitalized
* My favorite people
* Top Performers
* Shit List
