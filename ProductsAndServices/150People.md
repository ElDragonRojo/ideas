A very small social network for your 150 closest friends.

## Opportunity 

One complaint with traditional social networks is that you have so many "friends" that you don't have any actual friends. Thre's no way you can know all the people you are following, and certainly no way you can keep up with their lives with any degree of real empathy.

Twitter used to be something that was limited, so it was a useful way to communicate with your friends, unlike the noisy, data-heavy Facebook, which was more like a scrapbook you shared with your parents, and former and current classmates and coworkers.

The genius of Twitter was limiting what you could say in a message to 140 characters. As @ev said:

> You can change the world with 140 characters.

One of the ways you could improve Twitter further is to limit the number of people you can follow—preferably in a way that is purposeful and monetized sanely, right from the start.


## Theory

A social network limited to 150 people would force you to pick the people you really care about. Anybody else would have to be moved into a larger list of acquaintances that is more of a cloud for trends.


## Social

What makes this social network interesting is the inevitable scandal that results from having to admit who your real friends are. 150 people is a large enough list that it won't mess with your core group, but when it comes to Internet friends, there is a lot of potential for drama.

Leverage this by having each profile contain a detailed description of who this person is, and how you know them. These intimate profiles are made possible by the fact this will become an intensely curated list.


## Implementation

I would personally implement this as a feature of [Lemacs](https://github.com/lemurs/Lemacs), but you might build this as an app on top of ADN, then make versions for other existing social networks. That way you don't need to raise money for infrastructure and can spend the money on great people and [stickers](http://www.stickermule.com/unlock?ref_id=7501079601).

You can trivially prototype this anywhere you can make a list of people, such as:

* A list on Twitter
* A group in Address Book
* The spreadsheet of your choice
* Names on a piece of paper


## Monetization

What's nice about this idea as a business is you can use monetization to enhance the other important aspect of any great social network, which is as a _social experiment_.

The basic idea is that if you share everything openly, everything is free, but if the politics of your personal relationships are such that you want or need to keep secrets, _you'll have to pay_.

You can make as many lists as you want for free, but if you want them to be secret, or if you want to replace the politically meaningful numbers with more neutral bullet points, you'll have to pay.

As with GitHub, you can sign up for an account and have up to 150 friends with profiles for free, as well as unlimited acquaintences without profiles for free.

Like the GitHub model, you can purchase private profiles, as well as features like adding notes to acquaintences—but not full profiles, and **never more than 150 friends!**

You can also charge for the priviledge of sharing links, pictures, audio, movies, and other media. You do not have to pay for viewing these things: only for posting them.

Having to pay for these things pays for the bandwidth for hosting them, and it makes it much less likely that people will post crap, so the people consuming the media for free will enjoy it more.


## Lists

If you really want to spice things up, require that the lists be ordered, so you have to actually rank people. If you want to make the list unordered, to spare yourself the headache, you have to pay. If you think this would be too awkward in the main list, you can also just charge for other unordered lists, which you would want as an extension of using the free ordered lists, such as the infamous ten favorite people list.

Scandal aside, it's not necessarily a bad idea to let people know who the most important people in your life are. If something were to happen to you, it would be very important to have an easily accessible list of your most important people to notify. You can have some circles and sublists, such as:

* People to contact in case of emergency
* People to contact in case I am hopitalized
* My favorite people
* Top Performers
* Shit List

You could do something like limit the size of the lists to 10 people, except for the 150 person list, the aquaintence cloud, and the special lists you paid for.

Search results as smart lists could work the same way. Top 10 is free. To see them all, you have to pay. That money could be used to create curated lists that are worth paying for.
