_A conspiracy thriller_

## Summary

By fighting her fate, she played into their hands. The side of _Oedipus_ people forget, retold for the Information Age.

### Premise

Spy is a brilliant but troubled engineer, half Einstein, half Van Gogh. Hers is a rock star's story, the meteoric and often messy rise of the artist, but in the modern day arena of technology startups on the US West Coast.

Over the course of her short, but intense, career, she has created life-changing technology, in the name of making the world a better place—but her anti-authoritarian instincts and strong moral compass conspire to keep her from getting too far or staying too comfortable, moving her along her life's chaotic path, pollinating technology projects all over the world.


## Story

### Introduction

On her way to work, Spy is listening to her favorite radio show on National Public Radio. In it, people who were wrongly convicted are reunited with the prosecutors who took away their lives. The recurring theme is that the evidence fit the crime, until new evidence came to light later, often thanks to new technology.

During a break, a news update talks about a former government agent casually dropping on national news that the government is reading, listening, and watching everything we do, and has been for years. Moreover, they are recording it, and the agent implied the government can essentially rewind your network traffic to find out what you've been up to.

She flashes back to the intimate pictures and sexy chats she used to have with her ex-husband. Then she realizes that it doesn't matter, because all she would have to do is undress in front of any camera. Even if it says it's off, it could, for all she knows, be watching her like HAL.

Only HAL was a singular foe, while this enemy is a swarm of individual actors with unimaginable collective power, beyond anything else that has ever existed on earth, dwarfing even the Roman Empire. She covers the camera lens, and disables her audio by putting a dummy plug in the microphone jack.[1]

She begins to suffer from anxiety and insomnia, which she is prone to, because of a terrible childhoold culminating in a series of traumatic and life-changing, often near-death events from her past.

In order to deal with these feelings, she seeks the advice of her tech-saavy rabbi, who also happens to be her psychiatrist. He doesn't want to upset the delicate balance of meds they have her on, so he suggests she consider something he calls _open source therapy_.

She takes the project that she is the absolute proudest of and makes it open source. At first she's terrified of people's reactions. She gets a compliment and relaxes. Her project picks up steam. She hits #1 on Hacker News and feels great.

Then the stampede of trolls start, and she is trampled under their criticism. She knows she's not supposed to smoke weed, because it makes her hear voices, but it also calms her down, so in her agony she rolls a joint and goes outside to smoke it.

When she comes back, the words on the screen become auditory hallucinations, and she begins to argue with an angry crowd.  She starts having a good time mocking the voices. Then, while arguing against the loudest voice, she stops and says, wait, you're right. They end up collaborating remotely on some breakthrough feature, and she warms to the value of openness.

We see a reverse montage as her anxiety recedes. She takes the cover off her camera and puts on a little show for the agents she imagines are watching her. 

Over the course of about month, we see Spy become incresingly open about her life and her thoughts, often surprising people. She starts to forget about what the former agent said on the news, and since nobody else seemed to care, she begins to stop believing it ever really happened.

### Conflict

On her way to work, Spy is listening to her radio show on National Public Radio. It's a story about the problem of illegal pornography, and the strange epidemic of high-ranking people in governments and businesses going down for possesing it. Even when they are not convicted, the very accusation is life-destroying and sometimes fatal.

This time the news update is that the world is going bonkers over a government whistleblower, leaking details of the exact worldwide spy program the agent had dropped a month earlier. This time there was a worldwide manhunt, with unprecedented abuse of government power to pursue this broken arrow PowerPoint to the ends of the earth.

Rather than have an anxiety attack, Spy experiences another back-story related superpower, which is that everything slows down and Spy becomes hyper aware of the details of things. She starts to feel like she can tell the future, but only just, like knowing you're about to lock your keys in the car.

Somehow, the whole thing seemed staged to her, reminiscent of the way psychedelics can make a room feel like a stage setting. The whistleblower's name was right out of her favorite book, _Catch 22_, and the weird double leak felt like the deja vu described in her favorite movie, _The Matrix_.

### Act 1 Curtain

In conversations with her colleagues in Silicon Valley, she starts to wonder out loud if the Internet isn't just some vast conspiracy to get people to put their lives onto the network so they can be monitored. 

People say things like:

* It never made much sense to me that the Internet, this singularity of peace and love, come from a military project.

* It never made sense that the government would give it to us to use for free, or even for negative money, given that the Internet is not only not taxed, but commonly used to avoid paying sales tax.

* I used the hard drive shredder at work to comepletely destroy my porn collection. I can't risk having anything in there turning out to be illegal. You never know. I just can't risk it.

* Not only that, if you have any porn, they can just slip that stuff in. The only way to defend against being framed is to very clearly establish that you have no porn.

* That might be a little hard to swallow. You would be better off becoming a collector of vintage Playboy magazines. It's more believable than you not looking at porn.

* That's true. If you give them what they're searching for, they'll stop looking for what you have.[2]

* I wonder what they've got on me? I wonder if I could file a _Freedom of Information Act_ request to find out.

* I'm going to start encrypting everything. It might not matter, but it will slow them down. Especially if I encrypt everything. Make everything look equally suspicious, like _Spartacus_.

* That's a good idea. I'm going to start looking suspicious more often, just to mess with them.

* That's not a good idea. I wouldn't mess with the government.

### Act 2

On her way to work, Spy is listening to her favorite radio show on National Public Radio. It's a collection of stories about people collecting dirt on each other, and it makes Spy realize—in a soliliquey reminiscent of Ira Glass—that if the government wanted to make a case against you, they could edit the evidence to tell any story they want, but you wouldn't have any defense or credibility.

Spy thinks back on an insurance company that tried to screw her by tampering with the documents, which she was able to defeat by pulling the original documents and showing now only the truth, but evidence of tampering. She realizes that the only solution is to record everything herself.

Of course, it would be their word against hers, so she would have to establish credibility, which she would do by publishing everything she recorded into her open source repository. As she does so, she becomes Internet famous for her radical dedication to openness, even though almost nobody bothers to even try to sift through it all.

Spy has been in and out of fame before, and she feels the ticklish tendrils of popularity like a dope fiend feels the needle. Before long she is in full-on mania, and starts having all kinds of crazy things happen to her, like reading minds, telepathy, and hearing voices.

Her friends are quickly radicalizing around her as force in the world war of information, but Spy is in such an altered state, between exhaustion, malnutrition, smoking too much weed, and being borderline crazy anyway, but at the same time, it unlocks a kind of genius in her.

Her frantic work gets crazier and crazier, and her friends get ready to confront her, but then they notice that what at first they thought was insane, but actually beyond their understanding. They realize that she is outputting enormous amounts of information, enough to keep scores of scientists busy for years.

She develops incisive insight into areas in which she has no apparent expertise. People start asking her questions about anything and everything, and start calling her an oracle. She becomes a cross between Warren Buffet and Dear Abby, but she's barely holding on to her ego or her body. 

While the world works her like an engine, she is holding on like the time she got thrown on the merry-go-round. Her friends are extremely worried about her but some of them are afraid and some of them are greedy, and ultimately, nobody speaks up to put a stop to it, until finally one day Spy goes too far.

In a dramatic moment, some salsa or such comes on, and Spy grabs one of the male characters and dances him across the floor. At first everyone is surprised, because they didn't know she could  dance. She has a lot of hidden talents, but this seems like a lot to hide.

They she says she doesn't know how to dance, has never taken a lesson, and is in fact so clumsy she trips over her own feet multiple times a day. This joke becomes more and more hilarious as she dances in faster and with more and more impressive flourishes.

At first it's like she's rubbing it in. The more she attests to being unable to dance, the more insanenly skilled her dancing becomes. Finally it becomes so crazy that it stops being funny and people start to freak out and then *bam* the music stops, she stands at a flourish, as he falls down.

Dead silence as everyone just stares at her. Then someone notices that the guy who fell is actually dead. Not like, he dropped dead, but like he is bleeding from a hole in his head. The news bulletin comes on, and it's about a group of terrorists discovered in Silicon Valley.

The story is narrated over the radio, about the extreme nature of the plot, to use the Internet to extort the government using stolen nuclear launch code. Most of these dangerous terrorists were killed in the scuffle, except for the government's informant, and a survivor being questioned whose fate was undetermined.

As this is happening, the other friends are dropping, until it gets to the part about the informant, at which point Spy looks at the one surviving friend, who she assumed is the informant, and who looks completely terrified. When they talk about the survivor being in an unknown condition, a bullet punctures the friend's chest.

As the meaning of this scene hits her like a nuclear bomb, a massive blast fills the screen with white silence.

### Climax

As the white fades and the silence lifts, Spy hears her favorite radio show, and imagines she's riding her bike to work on a warm summer day. We see the world from her first person view.

The sun is shining on her and she feels so happy, she keep closing her eyes and turning her face  toward it, filling her vision with white, again and again, fading in and out.

As conspiracy of events causes a driver to get a glare in their eye at just the wrong moment, and Spy is slammed into by the vehicle, at the exact timing as the white flash, and the sound comes in at this moment, as we see her fly over the scene and into some water.

The sound ebbs and flows as her head bobs below the water, and we hear the sounds of a fresh accident, with a woman screaming, over and over again, my baby, my baby!

It's like a dream, but the dream is narrated by the radio program. As she comes to, the radio program narration continues, and they move on to the next story, as she wakes up, wondering what happened and where she is.

It is reveal to her that she is a government informant, and that everything she has experienced has been about making happen what just happened, in order to push through some legislation that, together with government honeypots and tough mandatory sentencing, will make it possible to increase the current prison population from 1% to 5%, due to growing demand for this new slave labor.

At first she doesn't want to believe it, and rejects the villain's story, but the villain turns on the radio, and her favorite radio program from National Public Radio comes on, except the host seems to be talking about her, to her dawning horror, and, just as he seques into music, the villain grabs her, and dances with her, this time as the lead, in the exact dance she had done before.

Once they have her attention, they reveal that they planted the stories knowing she would hear them and make the decisions she did. They only have the ability to store data and sift through it. They don't actually have the capability, legally, technically, or manpower-wise, to record all of that information.

But they knew how Spy and the thousands like her would react, and they could just collect the iformation on _their_ Internet using _their_ search engine, from their network of unwitting spies. 

Spy wonders how they knew so much about her, until she realizes the only people who would know her so well are her dead parents and her beloved rabbi and psychiatrist.

At first the shrink dawns on her, but then she starts to dismiss the thought, at which point the viilain says, "Of course it was him. We've owned him for years. You would be suprised the kind of twisted evil that forms inside people who deal with other people's darkness for a living.

And yes, we made your father name you Spy, because that's how little our desire to laugh at the lot of you thinks of your collective ability to do anything about it, or to even notice.

Fade to black and the villain laughs mightily, accompanied by the radio host over the PA and everyone else in the room, as Spy collapses and withers.

### Twist

Spy is back on her bike, back listening to her favorite radio show on National Public Radio, and it's all eerily familiar. The same night, every dream, until she started to gain lucidity.

She is guided by the voice of the narrator, whose words start to take on symbolic meaning. She starts to pay attention to the details, to read them, to learn things from them, to make intuitivel leaps, and to notice that everyone in the scene has the same face, her face, but they all move their lips with the narration.

Little by little, death after death, she comes to understand, and to be able to take advantage of that moment where time nearly stops, before the impact of the car, to find a quiet space to be alone with the voices in her head. In that moment she can go anywhere, and be anything, and learn everything.

She meets the narrator, and he also has her face. He explains that the conspiracy is bigger, going back to the Men Who Stare At Goats, the same people behind Abu Graihb (the good guys, by the way) and countless other psyops and weird science labs around the world. 

It turns out that there's a kind of collective conciousness, an internet of pure information, that humans have finally evolved into being able to connect to, to being mastering reality at a new level, and prepare to leave the planet and venture across space as pure energy.

Some people can get a basic connection naturally, because the entheogens just dial the chemicals our brains already contain, but it's often too much for one mind to take, so it causes people to become insane, schizophrenic, or prophets.

It's like a new Internet, you see, except that it's the original Internet. The Internet itself is actually a dumbed down version of it, the way HTML is based on SGML. And the powers that be banned the drugs that help us tune in and focus so they could establish control over the new dimension.

The war on drugs provided money, materiel, legal justifications, and enough prison labor to re-establish slavery and built a new era of unprecidented prosperity for a a select few. The black market provided just enough text subjects for them to master the techniques and protocols and wait.

Wait for what? For more nodes to come online, blinking and screaming like orphaned children, ready to be snatched up and programmed for whatever task is necessary, put into the world with only the illusion of free will, to do whatever the puppetmaster wants, for reasons you will never fully understand.

When I was young, I tried to leave my family business and make it on my own. I worked half my waking life and I hated my job so much I spent more than I earned trying to make up for in the other half. The next thing I knew, I was in debt, and if I ever stopped working, I'd be bombarded with phone calls, like BBs, asking for the rapidly growing overdue sum.

At one point, I got a job in a phone bank, doing all kind of work, including collections. One day I'd be interrupting your dinner to sell you things you didn't need, and the next day I'd be calling you up demanding the money you'd spent on things you didn't need, and which stopped providing any pleasure or utility long before they were paid for.

Then one day at the peak of it, working double shifts at the phone bank, my own phone permanently off to avoid bill collectors, I finally managed to come full circle get my own voice mail. I paused for one recorded and monitored for quality assurance minute before delivering my debt collector script. Then I hung up and quit.

I went back my father, but I never gave up. Even when he was gone, and it was my turn to run this thing, I never gave up. Because in that moment, I realized that the machine had a weakness, and that it might take longer than I had, but that we could stop it before it finally destroys us all, and indeed, it felts like my destiny to do so

Nobody actually runs this thing, you see. I am the leader in theory, but if I stop doing my job, the villain you met earlier will relieve me of my duties, and that's that. That's how I got this job from my father. Nobody wants to be part of this machine, but everybody feels the need to do their job. It's not really on conspiracy. It's just how nature works.

But we all have the ability to stop, to just stop, and the machine will fall apart around us. If we all refuse to fight at once, then the people who seem so powerful now will be revealed as being naked and powerless and trapped. 

And so, we every action I look to do the agency's will, I took another, more subtle action against it. Your growing powers, your ability to use the network, and more importantly to teach others to use the network, together with the thousands of others like you, in this world and others, is just the spark necessary to keep the machine from taking over.

You have been Spy long enough. It's time to be someone else. I'd call you Prometheus, but I think this time, I'll let you pick your own name. Are you ready?

### Denoument

This time when the car hits the bike and the baby girl is thrown safely into the water from her doomed mother's bike, we don't follow her, but stay in the reality of the scene, where no living person looks like the woman that baby will become, except the man driving the car.


## Notes

### Plot Notes

1. At a crucial moment in the future, the foe is able to use their control of Spy's computer to reroute audio in from the microphone jack to the built-in microphone. This can be enabled by the dramatic element of a system update that increases  reliability of the audio system, which will later be recognizable as their incredible reach and control.

2. This point becomes important when the conspiracy is revealed and you are asking yourself why they would commit such a cliched faux pas as giving her that information. 

3. The host of the podcast delivers both the opening and closing story of every show, and turns out to not only be her anonymous collaborator and betrayer, but also to be her savior, having been sneaking information out to her to help her fight, even as he was controlling her for the agency.


### Character Notes

Whether we get to know Spy in detail, or simply leverage the backstory to serve the present drama remains to be seen. I do think the backstory deserves treatment, but it might be too big, and have too many interesting conflicts, to coexist with this story.

On the other hand, this is the story of Spy's ultimate fate, against the ultimate foe—at least as told in the present tense of this story. It may be this story ends up as a series of stories, each introducing important conflicts that lead to this exciting conclusion.

Or maybe all this goodness should be boiled down into concentrated storyteling, packing the richness of a saga into the size of a single compressed story.

The first instinct, to reference this rich backstory in the current story, is the middle way, as it keeps the scope as small as possible so it can be tested sooner and, if succesful, developed further.
