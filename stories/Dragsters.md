# Dragsters

_Story premise. Great as a screenplay._

## Premise

A motocycle gang discovers their 2nd in command has been living a secret double life as a drag queen.

## Opening

A tough as nail motorcycle gang, the typical types with all the subtypes unified by their loud custom motocycles, leather, and hair.

But these are no mere Sunday riders. These are hard-baked outlaw bikers. Before we can grow to love them, we must learn to hate them.

The story opens with a montage of their violent doings, perhaps preparing for, and non-fatally executing, some kind of big heist.

We see them make their escape, rolling through the beautiful roads, experiencing the freedom of the open road through the ecstatic lens of getting away it.

As they roll into their clubhouse, we roll into the story.

## Act 1

We join the bikers as they burst into their clubhouse arms full of loot, and start diving up the proceeds and preparing to cut loose.

### Exposition

They realize there's no beer, and no bartender, and only then do they hear the silence broken by the piercing voice of the Diva. They all turn to see the Bartender, affixed horrified by the image on the screen.

It turns out that somehow he put together that the drag queen is the 2nd in command. There's dispute because it's impossible to tell for sure given all the make up and the wig and costume and all that, but the Stooge, who was cleaning up after things, found the costume among the 2nds things.

_This could be confrontational, but I envision this more as the Bartender and the stooge found this out literally at that moment, along with everyone else, and everyone is completely shocked at once._

### Curtain

At first, people aren't sure how to respond, until the leader surprises us with a gentle speech: 
"Bill, we sure do love you, and more than that, we respect you"

The leader recounts some of the brave things Bill has done.

"If anything about you was different, I'd be a dead man."

Other members also recount Bill's bravery, and they heartily accept him.


## Act 2

Happy but hectic times ensue as Bill tries to balance being a biker with being a drag queen, which begins to wear thin as both develop their own apparently unrelated escalations

### Exposition

There is some kind of huge event at the drag theater that Bill is getting ready for, that ends up becoming jeopardized in some way, causing the whole gang to have to step in, causing them all to become drag queens, escalating the situation to entire gang of queens.

Things with the bike gang become tense due to increasing tensions with and a crackdown by law enforcement. At first being queens seems like a good way to escape, but then they start losing territory and there starts to be a rift between who spends more time on which problem.

Two strong characters develops in the drag club aside from the bikers. The Diva, who is a bitter rival to the bikers, and her 2nd who develops sympathy for and shows friendship toward the bikers.

### Climax

Things at the club finally come to a head right before the big show, with the Diva threatening to bring the whole thing to naught, despite everyone's effort. She is stopped by her 2nd, who finally has enough, causing her to leave in disgrace.

The show does on, with the 2nd deferring the new Diva role to Bill, the biker 2nd who started it all. The show goes off amazingly, and the show ends on a high note.

_Snap to black as the lights go out and the crowd screams with uproarious applause._

### False Ending

As the credits roll over the black screen, we hear the cheering, which just keeps going, and an increasingly loud pounding sound. As the credits end, we fade in to the queens backstage, with the muffled cheering and chanting and pounding. Finally, someone remarks:

"They're going to tear the place apart unless you go back out there and give them an encore."

We fade back in to see the curtain open and the new Diva, starting the encore, as the crowd goes wild. As the encore picks up and the other queens come in, the crown noise dies down, but the pounding continues, until people start to notice.

The pounding continues, getting louder, eventually bringing everything to a halt for one bewildering moment, and the WHAM the doors are thrown open and cops in riot gear come streaming in, raiding the place, flash grenades, smoke, a lot of violence, bookending the introduction.

It's pandemonium as the cops start rounding people up. The chief announces that they're shutting the place down for all manner of terrible vice crimes being committed there. The former Diva's 2nd confronts the chief.

At first, this makes sense as she is now the club veteran. Then, the argument becomes oddly personal. Finally, the chief refers to the second as lieutenant.

## Reveal

It turns out that the dethroned Diva was the chief of police, the 2nd who betrayed him his top lieutenant. The raid is not because of the bikers, who he has no idea about, but in revenge for losing the fight.

At first the bikers are relieved they won't be discovered, but their relief fades as the chief / diva gives a big speech about framing the people in the club, throwing the full brunt of police resources to waste in the service of his vendetta. Things seem hopeless for everyone.

Then it turns out to commandant is a huge fan of drag, was in the audience with his family, and overheard the whole thing. The police, who themselves were unaware of this, turn on the chief / disgraced diva, and he is lead away.

## Denouement

When it's all over, we see Bill in his near future, when semi-unexpectedly, the lieutenant shows up, saying he knew he would find Bill here. Although this is the first time these men are seeing each other face to face like this, the lieutenant reveals he has known about the bikers all along, but that the way he sees it we're more alike than different, that the system needs a certain balance, and that what makes someone a hero or a villain is not the gang they roll with, but the effectiveness of their actions in improving the overall goodness in the system.

Because this is no regular place, but the magical place at the end of stories where it's revealed that the villains are actually noble Robin Hood types. The outlaw bikers have been robbing the bankers and their overpaid, sinister brethren to buy and burn the mortgages for the whole town. 

_Roll the rest of the credits._
