Ideas
=====

Ideas do not come from individuals, and do not belong to the people who have them. Ideas come from the zeitgeist, and belong to everyone. Ideas are only useful to people who have the time and ability to build them. An idea alone is useless, and anyone who is capable of building something probably has more ideas than they will ever be able to build.

These are some of the ideas I have had. I'm making them public both to illustrate their inherent uselessness and to claim them as prior art. You are free to take them, to share them, and to build them[*], but I reserve the right to work on them myself.

If you are also working on one of them, maybe we can be colleagues. Maybe we will be competitors. Maybe you will teach me a thing or two, or maybe you will slavishly copy everything I do and operate in bad faith, for which I will mock you.

What I will absolutely not do is trying to prevent other people from working on something by claiming an idea as property. Only assholes do that. I refuse to behave as if ideas themselves can be owned. That way lies madness.

[*] If you do use one of these ideas and make a ton of money, please [take care of the lemurs](http://savethelemur.org).
